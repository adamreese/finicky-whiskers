# Finicky Whiskers

A game that demonstrates wasm microservices. And the complex dietary whims of a cat called Slats.

### Development

See the root-level [README.md](../README.md) for steps to run Finicky Whiskers locally.

### Data Endpoint

Hit the `/session` endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:3000/session

This creates a data array for the game, which we can fetch and consume with the [`fetch()` JavaScript Interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).
